        "**Ans:** Circular importing means importing the two modules in each other. If suppose we are wokring in MOD1.py file and it is importing some function say F2() from some other module say MOD2.PY file or we can do vice-versa. What will happen is: This will give an import error.\n",

In that case it will return the module in which we are working on. Suppose if that moudle is being imported from some other module then name will have the name of that moudle from where the current module has been imported. The current module in which we are working is refer to the string **__main __.**"

        "**Ans:** RPN predates modern computers. It became useful with the advent of electronic calculators that were not great at handling complex expressions that needed brackets. As such, there is no need for brackets in RPN, because the calculators allow expressions to be entered in unambiguous postfix form."
